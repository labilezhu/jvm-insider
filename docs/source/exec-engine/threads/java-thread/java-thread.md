## JavaThread 状态 - JavaThreadState



[src/hotspot/share/utilities/globalDefinitions.hpp](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk//blob/890adb6410dab4606a4f26a942aed02fb2f55387/src/hotspot/share/utilities/globalDefinitions.hpp#L1030)

```c++
// JavaThreadState keeps track of which part of the code a thread is executing in. This
// information is needed by the safepoint code.
//
// There are 4 essential states:
//
//  _thread_new         : Just started, but not executed init. code yet (most likely still in OS init code)
//  _thread_in_native   : In native code. This is a safepoint region, since all oops will be in jobject handles
//  _thread_in_vm       : Executing in the vm
//  _thread_in_Java     : Executing either interpreted or compiled Java code (or could be in a stub)
//
// Each state has an associated xxxx_trans state, which is an intermediate state used when a thread is in
// a transition from one state to another. These extra states makes it possible for the safepoint code to
// handle certain thread_states without having to suspend the thread - making the safepoint code faster.
//
// Given a state, the xxxx_trans state can always be found by adding 1.
//
enum JavaThreadState {
  _thread_uninitialized     =  0, // should never happen (missing initialization)
  _thread_new               =  2, // just starting up, i.e., in process of being initialized
  _thread_new_trans         =  3, // corresponding transition state (not used, included for completeness)
  _thread_in_native         =  4, // running in native code
  _thread_in_native_trans   =  5, // corresponding transition state
  _thread_in_vm             =  6, // running in VM
  _thread_in_vm_trans       =  7, // corresponding transition state
  _thread_in_Java           =  8, // running in Java or in stub code
  _thread_in_Java_trans     =  9, // corresponding transition state (not used, included for completeness)
  _thread_blocked           = 10, // blocked in vm
  _thread_blocked_trans     = 11, // corresponding transition state
  _thread_max_state         = 12  // maximum thread state+1 - used for statistics allocation
};

```

其中 `class JavaThread` 的 `JavaThreadState _thread_state` 字段记录了线程的状态。
